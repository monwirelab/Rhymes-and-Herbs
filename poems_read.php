                        <h3>Worth</h3>
                        <p>Never measure your own value<br>
                        Based on what others do to you<br>
                        You're not defined by being seen<br>
                        Nor by how they have been.<br>
                        If you're forgotten, don't make a scene<br>
                        If you're not remembered, don't think they're mean<br>
                        Just go on and do what you gotta do<br>
                        You're not worth less if others don't see you.<br>
                        But don't be stingy with what you can give<br>
                        Just breathe, love, and believe<br>
                        Believe you're loved despite the funny ways<br>
                        People show that during these last days.<br>
                        Never be a reflection of how you're treated<br>
                        Be a mirror that gets bad rays deflected<br>
                        Shine and be a bright light to others' path<br>
                        You never know who'd benefit from that.<br>
